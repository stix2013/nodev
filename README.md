# Project Name

This project is a web application built with a modern tech stack, utilizing DDEV for local development. The frontend is a Next.js 15 application, and the backend is a Laravel 12 API.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application designed to showcase the integration of a modern frontend framework with a robust backend API. The application provides a seamless user experience for managing data and providing a service.

The frontend, built with Next.js 15, offers a dynamic and responsive user interface. It communicates with the backend API to fetch and display data, handle user authentication, and perform various other operations.

The backend, powered by Laravel 12, provides a secure and scalable RESTful API. It handles all the business logic, data storage, and other server-side operations.
