# Actions to Create the Users Page

This document outlines the steps taken to create the `users` page in the Next.js application.

1.  **Created a new git branch:**

2.  **Created the `users` page component:**
    *   Created the directory `webapp/src/app/users`.
    *   Created the file `webapp/src/app/users/page.tsx` with server-side data fetching from `https://api.nodev.ddev.site/users` and error handling.

3.  **Added a loading state:**
    *   Created the file `webapp/src/app/users/loading.tsx` to provide an instant loading UI.

4.  **Added navigation:**
    *   Modified `webapp/src/app/layout.tsx` to include a navigation link to the `/users` page.

5.  **Styled the `users` page:**
    *   Initially styled the page for readability.
    *   Updated the styling to match the home page for a consistent look and feel.
